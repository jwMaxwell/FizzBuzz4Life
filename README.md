# FizzBuzz4Life

FizzBuzz is one of the most simple programming challenges out there. That being said, simple doesn't necessarily mean easy. In most languages, FizzBuzz is a simple feat but in others it can be a real headache. There are also more creative solutions which may not be so simple to create or understand. This repository will act as a reference for each way I've completed this simple coding challenge.
